# VisualCube1e3
This project contains sourcecode of a [PROCESSING](https://processing.org) library for programming the VisualCube1e3 device, as well as PROCESSING sketches, little programs that make use of the PROCESSING API extended by the library to generate beautiful animations on the cubical device.

The VisualCube is a large volumetric color display designed of a thousand light emitting diodes. The lights are equidistantly arranged in a cubical frame with an edge length of 275 centimeters, easily controllable via wireless LAN. On [visualcube.org](http://www.visualcube.org) you can find detailed information and supplemental material related to the visualcube1e3 device.

# Binaries
If you do not want to build the library manually from the sources, you can download the binaries at the cube's [download page](http://visualcube.org/1e3/?page_id=18). There are also instructions on how to install the library into PROCESSING.

# Used Libraries
The sourcecode published here relies on the following libraries:

* The PROCESSING API, which includes
* the Java OpenGL library (JOGL), and
* the Apache XML-RPC library for communication with the device.
