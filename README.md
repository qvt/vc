# VisualCube1e3
This project contains sourcecode of a [PROCESSING](https://processing.org) library for programming the VisualCube1e3 device, as well as PROCESSING sketches, little programs that that use the extended PROCESSING API to generate animations on the cubical device.

The VisualCube is a large volumetric color display designed of a thousand light emitting diodes. The lights are equidistantly arranged in a cubical frame with an edge length of 275 centimeters, easily controllable via wireless LAN. On [visualcube.org](http://www.visualcube.org) you can find detailed information and supplemental material related to the visualcube1e3 device.
